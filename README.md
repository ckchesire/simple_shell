# Simple Shell

- The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or terminal, interprets them, and
 generally executes other commands. It is the program that is running when a user logs
 into a system.
- It serves as the interface between the user and the operating system. It takes commands entered
 by the user, interprets them, and passes them to the kernel to execute.
- A shell environment is called a REPL :  R-Read; E-Evaluate; P-Print; L-loop.
